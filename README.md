# Pokemon Data Analysis
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making.

Lets take an example that you want to become the best Pokemon player(even better than Ash Ketchum) in the world but in the world of pokemons you are lost. You can not figure out which pokemon is the best fit for specific purposes. This is the time when you should relax and utilize data analysis to get all your required information. I would love to make you a better trainer than Ash, so lets start.

Before I start,I want to talk about the course that helped me master Data Analysis using Python. "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas‚Äù is a practical, beginner-friendly and coding-focused introduction to data analysis covering the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas, data visualization and exploratory data analysis. You can earn a verified certificate of accomplishment by completing assignments and doing a course project. The lesson plan is awesome and it helps most effectively to grasp the important concepts required for data analysis.
